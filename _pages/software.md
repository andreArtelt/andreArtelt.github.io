<summary><b>CEML -- Counterfactuals for Explaining Machine Learning models - A Python toolbox</b></summary>
<div markdown=1>
[CEML](https://github.com/andreartelt/ceml) is a Python toolbox for computing counterfactuals. Counterfactuals can be used to explain the predictions of machine learing models.

It supports many common machine learning frameworks:
- scikit-learn (1.3.1)
- PyTorch (2.0.1)
- Keras & Tensorflow (2.13.1)

Furthermore, CEML is easy to use and can be extended very easily. See the following user guide for more information on how to use and extend CEML.

### Installation

*Note: Python 3.8 is required!*

#### PyPI

    pip install ceml

**Note**: The package hosted on PyPI uses the cpu only. If you want to use the gpu, you have to install CEML manually - see next section.

#### Git

Download or clone the repository:


    git clone https://github.com/andreArtelt/ceml.git
    cd ceml

Install all requirements:


    pip install -r requirements.txt

**Note**: If you want to use a gpu/tpu, you have to install the gpu version of jax, tensorflow and pytorch manually. Do not use ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.

Install the toolbox itself:


    pip install .


### Quick example


    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

    from ceml.sklearn import generate_counterfactual


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # Load data
        X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=4242)

        # Whitelist of features - list of features we can change/use when computing a counterfactual 
        features_whitelist = None   # We can use all features

        # Create and fit model
        model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3)
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)

        # Select data point for explaining its prediction
        x = X_test[1,:]
        print("Prediction on x: {0}".format(model.predict([x])))

        # Compute counterfactual
        print("\nCompute counterfactual ....")
        print(generate_counterfactual(model, x, y_target=0, features_whitelist=features_whitelist))
