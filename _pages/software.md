[CEML](https://github.com/andreartelt/ceml) is a Python toolbox for computing counterfactuals. Counterfactuals can be used to explain the predictions of machine learing models.

It supports many common machine learning frameworks:
- scikit-learn (1.3.1)
- PyTorch (2.0.1)
- Keras & Tensorflow (2.13.1)

Furthermore, CEML is easy to use and can be extended very easily. See the following user guide for more information on how to use and extend CEML.
