Welcome! I am a post-doctoral researcher in the [Machine Learning Group](https://hammer-lab.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/doku.php) at [Bielefeld University](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/) and a visiting researcher at [KIOS Research and Innovation Center of Excellence](https://www.kios.ucy.ac.cy/) at the [University of Cyprus](https://www.ucy.ac.cy/).

My primary area of research is *trustworthy AI*, and my secondary area of research is *AI for critical infrastructure*.
I mainly focus on eXplainable AI (XAI) -- in particular on contrasting explanations. Besides fundamental research, I also work on applications of XAI, such as to water distribution networks, transportation, and decision support systems for business owners.
