Welcome! I am a post-doctoral researcher in the [Machine Learning Group](https://hammer-lab.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/) at [Bielefeld University](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/) and a visiting researcher at [KIOS Research and Innovation Center of Excellence](https://www.kios.ucy.ac.cy/) at the [University of Cyprus](https://www.ucy.ac.cy/).

My research interests are centered around *Trustworthy AI in Critical Domains*, with a special focus on eXplainable AI *(XAI)* -- in particular on contrasting/counterfactual explanations.
Besides basic research, I also work on applications of (X)AI in domains such as water distribution systems, transportation, and decision support systems for business owners.
