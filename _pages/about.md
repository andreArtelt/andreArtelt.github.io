Welcome! I am a researcher in the [Machine Learning Group](https://hammer-lab.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/doku.php) at [Bielefeld University](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/).

My research mainly focuses on eXplainable AI (XAI) -- in particular on contrasting explanations. Besides fundamental research, I also work on applications of XAI, such as to water distribution networks, transportation, and decision support systems for business owners.
